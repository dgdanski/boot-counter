# Boot counter

Hi,</br>
Unfortunately I didn't finish the task because I got stuck at resolving some gradle issues according to Room DAO. 
Because of that I coudn't compile a project, so there is no apk file.
That's why there is a ToDo list:
1. Fix issues with gradle / Room.
2. Add code in Worker which will launch an appropriate Notification to the user.
3. Handle dissmiss action for Notification.
4. Add UI components to handle change of “Total dismissals allowed” and “Interval between dismissals”.
5. Add unit tests.
6. Add more logs.
8. Disable logging in release mode.
9. Handle various error use cases.
10. Create keystore and configure release build variant.
